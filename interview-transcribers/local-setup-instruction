# Whisper Audio Transcription

This guide will help you set up and run the Whisper audio transcription code on your computer.

## Prerequisites

1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Install FFmpeg**: Whisper requires FFmpeg for audio processing. You can install it using your system's package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, run:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install ffmpeg
   ```

## Steps to Run the Code

1. **Create a new directory for your project** and navigate to it in your terminal:
   ```bash
   mkdir whisper_transcription
   cd whisper_transcription
   ```

2. **Create a new Python virtual environment** to keep your project dependencies isolated:
   ```bash
   python -m venv myenv
   ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment**:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     myenv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS or Linux:
     ```bash
     source myenv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install the Whisper library** inside the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   pip install git+https://github.com/openai/whisper.git
   ```

5. **Create a new Python file** (e.g., `transcribe.py`) and copy the following code into it:
   ```python
   import whisper

   # Load Whisper model
   model = whisper.load_model("large")  # You can also use 'tiny', 'small', 'medium', or 'large'

   # Transcribe an interview audio file
   result = model.transcribe("/path/to/your/audio/file.m4a")

   # Get the transcription text
   transcription_text = result["text"]

   # Save transcription to a text file
   with open("transcription.txt", "w") as file:
       file.write(transcription_text)

   print("Transcription saved to 'transcription.txt'")
   ```

6. **Replace `/path/to/your/audio/file.m4a`** with the actual path to your audio file that you want to transcribe.

7. **Save the file** and run the script:
   ```bash
   python transcribe.py
   ```

8. **Check the output**: The transcription will be saved to a file named `transcription.txt` in the same directory as your script.

## Notes

- Remember to activate your virtual environment before running the script to ensure that the Whisper library is available.
- If you encounter any issues or errors, double-check that you have followed all the steps correctly and that you have the necessary dependencies installed (Python and FFmpeg).

Happy transcribing!
